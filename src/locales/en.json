  "suitability1": "It should be possible to drill at your location! Contact your cantonal water protection office to learn more about your canton's regulations, whether there are any depth restrictions, and how you can apply for a permit. Your cantonal energy department can also provide information on subsidy eligibility. Meet with a specialist to determine the best drilling approach for your location. We recommend you get two to three quotes for the installation of a BHE / geothermal heat pump before you make a decision.",

  "suitability2": "In many cases, drilling for a borehole heat exchanger is possible. Contact a consultant on heating with renewable energy (or, 'impulse consultant'), or schedule a personal energy consultation. Heating system installation and drilling companies in your area and your cantonal water protection office can also provide you with more information.",

  "hint1": "Geothermal energy is a kind of energy that is stored in the form of heat below the earth's surface. It can be used to heat and in certain cases even cool buildings, for instance by using a borehole heat exchanger (BHE) along with a geothermal heat pump. In Switzerland, you need a permit to drill into the ground to install a BHE. For water protection and other reasons, drilling/operating a BHE may not be permitted at all in certain areas, or only permitted if certain conditions are met. Regulations vary between cantons.",
  "hint2": "Cantons provide suitability maps that make it possible to determine quickly and cost effectively how likely it is a drilling permit will be granted for a specific location. However, not all cantons have made their maps digitally available or accessible online via an interface. The application on www.kann-ich-bohren.ch provides an interface for all of the cantonal suitability maps that can be accessed in this way. Suitability can be queried for all cantons except Basel-Stadt, Fribourg, Jura, Neuchâtel, Nidwalden, Obwalden and Solothurn. In addition, suitability maps can be accessed for all cantons except Basel-Stadt, Neuchâtel, Solothurn.",
  "hint3": "This application allows homeowners and consulting experts to quickly determine whether drilling for a borehole heat exchanger may be possible at their location. This application makes it possible to evaluate your options at an early stage of planning. No legal claim can be derived from these maps. If drilling for a BHE is possible, you should check the corresponding cantonal map to see if any restrictions apply. If you are going ahead with a building project, we recommend you apply for a permit as soon as possible. Your cantonal water protection office can give you more information. Depending on where you live, your permit application may have to be submitted to either the cantonal or communal authorities.",
